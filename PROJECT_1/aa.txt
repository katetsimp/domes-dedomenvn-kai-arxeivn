soon after the end of the German occupation of Greece, the issue of
establishing a University on Crete was brought up and reached its peak during
the 1960's. However, although public demand for the establishment of a
university on Crete was unanimous, there was also an intense rivalry between
the two major cities on the island on which one would become the seat of that
university. Finally, the solution to the problem was given in 1977 by the then
Prime Minister Konstantinos Karamanlis, who made a balanced decision approving
both the establishment of a University with faculties in Heraklion and
Rethymnon and the establishment of a Technical University in Chania.

The Technical University of Crete was established by the Law 545/77 on the
"Establishment of a Technological Institution under the title Technical
University of Crete and other provisions". On July 17th 1977, the first
Executive Committee of the Institution convened under the presidency of
Professor Perikles Theoharis and in the presence of the then Minister of
National Education G. Rallis, consisting of the Mayor of the City of Chania
and the President of the Western Crete Section of the Technical Chamber of
Greece, representing the local element which had shown great interest in the
establishment of the University.
